# Introduction
Design a Metroidvania style project, including resused art assets from the Atari ST version of [ThunderCats: The Lost Eye of Thundera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThunderCats_(1987_video_game))

# Sprites
The sprites are presented as a Bitmap sprite sheet using the popular _hot pink_ background colour `#ff00ff` and as a gif to demonstrate.

Each frame has been ripped using [AnimGet](https://mugenarchive.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&id=61108-animget-michael-menne) and composed using Photoshop.

## Liono

The main protagonist of the game. Liono has animation frames for walking, crouching and jumping. As well as attack animations for these stances.

`Each frame is 64x64 pixels in size`
